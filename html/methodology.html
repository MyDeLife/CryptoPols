            <h1>Sentiment Assessment Parameters</h1>
            <p>This section describes the evaluation criteria used to assess the sentiment by US politicians towards the
                crypto industry, web3 ecosystem and blockchain technology. CryptoPols uses a variety of sources to get
                information of US politicians to evaluate their crypto sentiment, most notably legislative actions
                (i.e. sponsoring a crypto-related bill), press releases, news articles as well as direct
                statements (i.e. tweets posted on the topic of crypto). Every event is assessed individually and a
                politician's overall sentiment constitutes the aggregate of past assessments, where more recent
                assessments receive higher weightings.</p>
            </br>
            <p>CryptoPols is currently in development and assessments are in the process of being conducted. The results
                will be published on this website upon completion. CryptoPols relies on its user base to conduct
                holistic, transparent and equitable assessments. Your opinion on the assessment paramaters and sources
                used to evaluate are important to us, as we are looking to establish a methodology with broad
                consensus. Feel free to provide any feedback by clicking the give feedback button.

            <div id="pro-assess">
                <p>The following classifications are interpreted as <span>pro-crypto</span> sentiment, which includes
                    statements, opinions and actions taken by a politician where he/she:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Views crypto, web3 and blockchain technology as an innovative segment with futurue
                        growth potential.</li>
                    <li>Engages in meaningful regulation of the crypto industry, which includes making crypto a more
                        secure place for citizens to perform crypto transactions with reduced risks of economic
                        attacks by malicious actors.</li>
                    <li>Discourages punitive regulatory enforcement actions taken on the basis of frameworks
                        that may not clearly apply to (parts of) the crypto industry.</li>
                    <li>Recognizes the need for privacy in crypto for its citizens, where government restrains itself
                        from taking advantage of blockchain technology features to implement programs aimed to surveil
                        and control its people.</li>
                    <li>Expresses opposition against the idea of implementing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs),
                        arguing that CBDCs open the door for governments to enact tighter controls over financial
                        transactions of their people and are therefore against the spirit of freedom, liberty and
                        universal access to finance that crypto aims to accomplish, among other things.</li>
                    <li>Shows support for investments into decentralized crypto infrastructure and applications,
                        both in the public and private sector.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrates a constructive and positive approach in communicating messages and legislative
                        actions that aim to gain broader consensus around the benefits of crypto.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Believes that crypto does not produce any value for society.</li>
                    <li>Expresses that crypto is predominantly used by malicious actors, such as money launderers,
                        terrorist groups and pariah states.</li>
                    <li>Supports implementing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</li>
                    <li>Promotes restricting access to crypto via regulations that limit the ability of citizens to
                        perform financial crypto transactions, work in web3 or otherwise engage in doing business in
                        crypto.</li>
                    <li>Encourages broad and punitive regulatory enforcement actions towards the crypto industry
                        without regards for nuanced applicability of existing laws and regulations, and without
                        regards for its impact on innovation and all stakeholders in the crypto ecosystem.</li>
                    <li>Supports shutting down the crypto industry.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrates an adversarial and negative mindset towards the benefits of crypto and towards
                        supporters of web3 and blockchain technology.</li>
