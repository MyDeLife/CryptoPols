        <h2>Sentiment Assessment Parameters</h2>
        <p>This section describes the evaluation criteria used to assess the sentiment by US politicians towards the
            crypto industry, web3 ecosystem and blockchain technology. CryptoPols uses a variety of sources to get
            information of US politicians to evaluate their crypto sentiment, most notably legislative actions taken,
            (i.e. sponsoring a crypto-related bill), press releases, news articles as well as direct statements
            (i.e. tweets posted on the topic of crypto). Every event is assessed individually and a politician's
            overall sentiment constitutes the aggregate of past assessments, where more recent assessments receive
            higher weightings.</p>
        </br>
        <p>CryptoPols is currently in development and assessments are in the process of being conducted. The results
            will be published on this website upon completion. CryptoPols relies on its user base to conduct holistic,
            transparent and equitable assessments. Your opinion on the assessment paramaters and sources used to
            evaluate are important to us, as we are looking to establish a methodology that has gained broad
            consensus. Feel free to provide any feedback by clicking the button on the bottom right of the
            <a href="https://cryptopols.com/">Home</a> page.

        <div id="pro-assess">
            <p>The following classifications are interpreted as <span>pro-crypto</span> sentiment, which includes
                statements, opinions and actions taken by a politician where he/she:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Views crypto, web3 and blockchain technology as an innovative segment with distinguished futurue
                    growth potential.</li>
                <li>Engages in meaningful regulation of the crypto industry, which includes making crypto a more
                    secure place for citizens to perform crypto transactions with reduced risks of economic
                    attacks by malicious actors.</li>
                <li>Recognizes the need for privacy in crypto for its citizen, where government restrains itself from
                    taking advantage of blockchain technology features to implement programs aimed to surveil and
                    control its people.</li>
                <li>Expresses opposition against the idea of implementing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs),
                    arguing that CBDCs open the door for governments to place tighter controls over financial
                    transactions of their people and are therefore against the spirit of freedom, liberty and universal
                    access to finance that crypto aims to accomplish, among other things.</li>
                <li>Shows support for investing into decentralized crypto infrastructure and applications,
                    both in the public and private sector.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Believes that crypto does not produce any value for society.</li>
                <li>Expresses that crypto is exclusively used by bad actors, such as money launderers, terrorist groups

                <li>Supports shutting down the crypto industry.</li>
